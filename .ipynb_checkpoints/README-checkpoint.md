# Sparkify Data Warehouse: Data Warehouse with Redshift

This project creates a ETL pipeline written in Python to process two different datasets, logs and songs, and load them into Redshift with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. 

Firtly, the ETL pulls data from an S3 bucket and loads it to staging tables on Redshift, then, it executes SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

This project was build reusing the code from my other Sparkify Projects:
 - [Sparkify Postgres](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-postgres)
 - [Sparkify Data Lake](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-datalake)
 - [Sparkify Airflow](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-airflow)
 
The Jupyter notebook [setup_cluster.ipynb]() was taken mostly from Lesson 3 - Exercise 2 of Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree.
 

## Datasets

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`

`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

```javascript
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like (just the first 5 rows).

## Database

![Entity-Relatioship Diagram](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/images/sparkifydb_erd.png)

The Redshift tables were designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. 

To achieve that, it was created two staging tables to receive the logs and the songs data via bulk inserts using the PostgreSQL `copy` command:

#### Staging Tables
 1. **staging_events** - records in log data files
    - artist, auth, firstName, gender, itemInSession, lastName, length, level, location, method, page, registration, sessionId, song, status, ts, userAgent, userId
 2. **staging_songs** - records in song data files
    - num_songs, artist_id, artist_latitude, artist_longitude, artist_location, artist_name, song_id, title, duration, year


Also, it was created a  star schema including the following tables:

#### Fact Table
 1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables
 2. **users** - users in the app
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
 3. **songs** - songs in music database
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
 4. **artists** - artists in music database
    - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
 5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*


### Prerequisites

The solution was built using Python 3.6.3. For the complete package list used to build and run this application, please refer to the file [requirements-env.txt](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/requirements-env.txt) 


### How to run

1. Fill the file `dwh.cfg` with your AWS credentials (access key and secret). Also, feel free to change the DWH properties that will be used to set up the cluster in the next step.

2. Set up the Redshift cluster by following the steps 0-4 in the the notebook [setup_cluster.ipynb](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/setup_cluster.ipynb).

3. Then, run the application via CLI:

```
python create_tables.py
python etl.py
```

4. Run analytic queries in the notebook [analytics.ipynb](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/analytics.ipynb).

5. Delete the Redshift cluster by following the step 5 in the notebook [setup_cluster.ipynb](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/setup_cluster.ipynb).

## Analytics queries

There are some analytics and other useful queries in the notebook [analytics.ipynb](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/analytics.ipynb).


## ER Diagram generation

The ER Diagram can be generated using the `sqlalchemy_schemadisplay` package by running the following script:
```
python create_erd.py
```
